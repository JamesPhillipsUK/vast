# VAST

VAST - Visualise Abstract Syntax Trees for Python.

VAST generates ASTs for a given Python script and builds visualisations of them.

## Install

Install from PyPI [Here!](https://pypi.org/project/VisAST/)

## How to use

From a python script:

```python
from vast.vast import Vast

v = Vast("./helloworld.py")
# or
v = Vast()
ast = v.generateAST("./helloworld.py")
v.visualiseASTGraph(ast)
```

Or (if installed from source, rather than pip) from the terminal:

```bash
python vast.py ./helloworld.py
```
